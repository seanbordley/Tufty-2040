1 Find or create the media that you want to put on your TUfty 2040
2 You will then need to extract the media into sequential frames.
  2a https://ezgif.com/ this site can extract from both gifs and videos but I prefer ffmpeg for video file extraction. Your files must be in .jpg format.
  2b make sure to resize your files to the appropriate screen resolution, if it's a video you cat use that site to change resolution and cut the length, then use FFmpeg.
  2c ffmpeg -i input.mp4 '%04d.jpg
3 Place all sequential files in a folder, I have chosen the name Pedro, but you can change that to a different name just update the script.
4 Using Thonny upload save script and using Thonny's built in file upload system you can upload the folder containing all your sequential images... This process can take awhile
5 Enjoy never forget this step.
